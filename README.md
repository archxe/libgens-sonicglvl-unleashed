# libgens-sonicglvl-unleashed

This is a version of SonicGLvl which primarily focuses on Sonic Unleashed (X360/PS3) level editing.
This fork includes:
- Daytime Sonic Objects, Gimmicks, Enemies and Bosses
- Mission Objects and Gimmicks
- Werehog Objects, Gimmicks, Enemies and Bosses
- System Objects for loading terrain, cameras, etc.
- Tornado Defence Objects
- Town Objects such as NPCs
- Stage/Country-specific gimmick objects

This does not include: Sonic Unleashed Shaders (which means a majority of stages will render incorrectly) and Object models for the editor (these must be extracted from the game files yourself).
I plan to update these templates to add any missing objects (mostly from missions and unused objects not present in any existing layouts)
The more detailed templates were provided to me by GordinRamsay (https://github.com/GordinRamsay) and uploaded with consent.
